## [v0.10.3] — Unreleased


  [v0.10.3]: https://github.com/theory/jsonpath/compare/v0.10.2...v0.10.3

## [v0.10.2] — 2025-10-14

### 📔 Notes

*   Upgraded to `golangci-lint` v2.5.0.
*   Removed unused constant from `parser/lex.go`

### 🐞 Bug Fixes

*   Fixed bug that prevented multiple blank-space delimited ANDed comparison
    operations from being parsed. For example, `$[@.x=="hi"&&@.y!=3&&@[1]==1]`
    would parse but `$[@.x == "hi" && @.y !=3 && @[1]==1]` would not. Thanks
    to @jarangutan for the bug report and @jg-rp for the analysis ([#24]).

    "theory/jsonpath#24 Filter with 2+ consecutive '&&' operators returns parsing error"

## [v0.10.1] — 2025-09-16

### 🐞 Bug Fixes

*   Allow `true`, `false`, and `null` to be used as selectors, e.g., `$.true`.

### 📔 Notes

*   Upgraded to `golangci-lint` v2.3.1.
*   Fixed test name scoping issues with testify objects.
*   Upgraded the [compliance test suite], now with tests using `true`,
    `false`, and `null` to be used as selectors.

## [v0.9.0] — 2025-05-05

### ⚡ Improvements

*   Significantly refactored the `spec` package toward greater stability,
    usability, and increased comprehensibility. The names of things are more
    consistent, the APIs more legible and user-friendly. Quite a few types
    were renamed or merged.
*   Added support for [json.Number] values to complement the existing support
    for Go core numeric types. This should allow for transparent handling of
    values marshaled with [json.Decoder.UseNumber] enabled.
*   Moved the function extension types from the `registry` to the `spec`
    package, simplifying `registry` and the handling of function extensions,
    without changing the interface for using a registry or adding extensions
    to it.

### 📚 Documentation

*   Vastly expanded the `spec` package documentation to make it much more
    thorough and accurate, with copious links to relevant parts of [RFC 9535]
    and complete lists of interface implementations and examples for each
    significant type.
*   Removed the "Package Stability" statement from the README, as all packages
    are considered stable or else potentially unstable types in the `spec`
    package have been labeled as such.
*   Fixed links and typos in the main package documentation, and moved the
    registry example under `WithRegistry`.
*   Replaced the `spec.Wildcard` variable with a the function
    `spec.Wildcard()`.

### 📔 Notes

*   Upgraded the [compliance test suite] and integrated its located path test
    expectations. All tests passed, no changes required.

## [v0.4.1] — 2025-05-02

### 🪲 Bug Fixes

*   Fixed the panic messages from `spec.Slice` to properly report coming from
    `Slice` and not `NewSlice`.

### 📔 Notes

*   Upgraded to and fixed issues reported by `golangci-lint` v2.1.5.
*   Added TinyGo testing on Go v1.24.

  [v0.4.1]: https://github.com/theory/jsonpath/compare/v0.4.0...v0.4.1

## [v0.4.0] — 2025-01-15

### ⚡ Improvements

*   Added the `Pointer` method to `NormalizedPath`. It returns an [RFC 9535
    JSON Pointer] string representation of the normalized path.

  [v0.4.0]: https://github.com/theory/jsonpath/compare/v0.3.0...v0.4.0
  [RFC 9535 JSON Pointer]: https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9535#name-normalized-paths

## [v0.3.0] — 2024-12-28

### ⚡ Improvements

*   Added `SelectLocated`. It works just like `Select`, but returns
    `LocatedNode`s that pair the selected nodes with [RFC 9535-defined]
    `NormalizedPath`s that uniquely identify their locations within the JSON
    query argument.
*   Added `LocatedNodeList`, the return value from `SelectLocated`. It
    contains methods for working with the selected nodes, including iterators
    for its nodes & `NormalizedPath`s, deduplication, sorting, and cloning.
*   Added `Compare` to `NormalizedPath`, which enables the sorting of
    `LocatedNodeList`s.

### 📔 Notes

*   Requires Go 1.23 to take advantage of its iterator support.
*   Changed the return value of `Select` from `[]any` to `NodeList`, which is
    an alias for `[]any`. Done to pair with `LocatedNodeList`, the return
    value of `SelectLocated`. Features an `All` method, which returns an
    iterator over all the nodes in the list. It may gain additional methods in
    the future.

### 📚 Documentation

*   Added `Select`, `SelectLocated`, `NodeList`, and `LocatedNodeList`
    examples to the Go docs.

  [v0.3.0]: https://github.com/theory/jsonpath/compare/v0.2.1...v0.3.0
  [RFC 9535-defined]: https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9535#section-2.7

## [v0.2.1] — 2024-12-12

### 🪲 Bug Fixes

*   Fixed the formatting of slice strings to omit min and max integers when
    not specified and using a negative step.

  [v0.2.1]: https://github.com/theory/jsonpath/compare/v0.2.0...v0.2.1

## [v0.2.0] — 2024-11-13

### ⚡ Improvements

*   Added `spec.Filter.Eval` to allow public evaluation of a single JSON node.
    Used internally by `spec.FilterSelector.Select`.
*   Added `spec.Segment.IsDescendant` to tell wether a segments selects just
    from the current child node or also recursively selects from all of its
    descendants.

### 🪲 Bug Fixes

*   Added missing "?" to the stringification of `spec.FilterSelector`.

### 📔 Notes

*   Made `spec.SliceSelector.Bounds` public.
*   Made the underlying struct defining `spec.Wildcard` public, named it
    `spec.WildcardSelector`.

  [v0.2.0]: https://github.com/theory/jsonpath/compare/v0.1.2...v0.2.0

## [v0.1.2] — 2024-10-28

### 🪲 Bug Fixes

*   Eliminated a lexer variable that prevented [TinyGo] compilation.

### 🏗️ Build Setup

    TinyGo WASM.
*   Added the WASM compile test to the [Test and Lint] GitHub action.

    may change
*   More detailed documentation to come
